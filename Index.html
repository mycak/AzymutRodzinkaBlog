                        <p>The importance of the Arabs as traders in the Indian Ocean by the 12th century may partly explain why the last Buddhist king of Maldives, Dhovemi, converted to Islam in the year 1153 (or 1193). Adopting the Muslim title of Sultan Muhammad al Adil, he initiated a series of six Islamic dynasties that lasted until 1932 when the sultanate became elective. The formal title of the sultan up to 1965 was, Sultan of Land and Sea, Lord of the twelve-thousand islands and Sultan of the Maldives which came with the style Highness.

                                Somali Muslim Abu'l Barakat al-Barbari, also known as Aw Barkhadle, is traditionally credited for this conversion. According to the story told to Ibn Battutah, a mosque was built with the inscription: 'The Sultan Ahmad Shanurazah accepted Islam at the hand of Abu'l Barakat al-Barbari.'[30][31] Some scholars have suggested the possibility of Ibn Battuta misreading Maldive texts, and having a bias towards the North African, Maghrebi narrative of this Shaykh, instead of the East African origins account that was known as well at the time.[32] Even when Ibn Battuta visited the islands, the governor of the island at that time was Abd Aziz Al Mogadishawi, a Somali[33]
                                
                                Scholars have posited another scenario where this Abu Barakat might have been a native of Barbera, a significant trading port on the northwestern coast of Somalia.[34] Barbara or Barbaroi (Berbers), as the ancestors of the Somalis were referred to by medieval Arab and ancient Greek geographers, respectively.[35][36][37] This is also seen when Ibn Batuta visited Mogadishu, he mentions that the Sultan at that time, "Abu Bakr ibn Shaikh Omar", was a Berber (Somali). According to scholars, Abu Barakat Al Barbari was Yusuf bin Ahmad al-Kawneyn, a famous native Somali scholar [38] known for establishing the Walashma dynasty of the Horn of Africa.[39] After his conversion of the population of Dogor (now known as Aw Barkhadle), a town in Somalia, he is also credited to have been responsible for spreading Islam in the Maldivian islands, establishing the Hukuru Miskiiy Mosque, and converting the Maldivian population to Islam.[40][41] Ibn Batuta states the Maldivian king was converted by Abu Al Barakat Al Berber (Blessed Father of Somalia).[42]
                                
                                Others have it he may have been from the Persian town of Tabriz.[43] The first reference to an Iranian origin dates to an 18th-century Persian text.[44]
                                
                                His venerated tomb now stands on the grounds of Hukuru Mosque, or miski, in the capital of Malé. Built in 1656, this is the oldest mosque in Maldives. Following the Islamic concept that before Islam there was the time of Jahiliya (ignorance), in the history books used by Maldivians the introduction of Islam at the end of the 12th century is considered the cornerstone of the country's history.
                                
                                Compared to the other areas of South Asia, the conversion of the Maldives to Islam happened relatively late. Arab traders had converted populations in the Malabar Coast since the 7th century, and Muhammad Bin Qāsim had converted large swathes of Sindh to Islam at about the same time. The Maldives remained a Buddhist kingdom for another 500 years after the conversion of Malabar Coast and Sindh—perhaps as the southwesternmost Buddhist country. Arabic became the prime language of administration (instead of Persian and Urdu), and the Maliki school of jurisprudence was introduced, both hinting at direct contacts with the core of the Arab world.
                                
                                Middle Eastern seafarers had just begun to take over the Indian Ocean trade routes in the 10th century and found Maldives to be an important link in those routes as the first landfall for traders from Basra sailing to Southeast Asia. Trade involved mainly cowrie shells—widely used as a form of currency throughout Asia and parts of the East African coast—and coir fiber. The Bengal Sultanate, where cowrie shells were used as legal tender, was one of the principal trading partners of the Maldives. The Bengal–Maldives cowry shell trade was the largest shell currency trade network in history.[45] The other essential product of the Maldives was coir, the fibre of the dried coconut husk, resistant to saltwater. It stitched together and rigged the dhows that plied the Indian Ocean. Maldivian coir was exported to Sindh, China, Yemen, and the Persian Gulf.</p>

                        <h2>Jambooo !</h2>
                        <p>
                            Małe podsumowanie z naszego pobytu na Zanzi.
                            Byliśmy na wyspie 6 intensywnych dni nocujac w Jambiani.
                            
                            Stone town - jak byśmy lecieli jeszcze raz na taki krótki okres to napewno zostalibyśmy w stone town przynajmniej na dwa dni. Raz że stone jest bazą wypadową na wycieczki a dwa że nie da się zobaczyć calego miasta przez parę godzin. Jeżeli chodzi o nocny market to nie było rzeczy która nam nie smakowała a próbowaliśmy i pizzy i owoców morza i lokalnych specjałów. Cenowo wszędzie tak samo. Najlepiej wybrać to co wpadnie w oko.
                            
                            Prision Island - w moim odczuciu miejsce które warto zobaczyc. Fakt, że poza żółwiami nic specjalnego nie ma ale za to można z nimi poobcowac, dotknąć i podziwiać. Warto poplynac tak jak my ok 16 i wracać o zachodzie kiedy slonce tonie w oceanie.
                            
                            Blue safari - spotkalismy się ze sporym zawodem, dla ludzi znających temat sand banku z innych miejsc nie polecam. Poza sand bankiem pozwalają Ci "trochę" posnurkowac. Jedynym plusem wycieczki był 500 letni baobab. Jedzenie w porównaniu do jedzenia na zanzi mocno przeciętne. Dodatkowo w tym samym miejscu co jesz łażą szczury wielkości kotów. Dodatkowo przy średniej pogodzie jak w naszym wypadku to widoki były żadne. 30 dolców za 4 godziny podróży (dojazd w jedną stronę to samochodem godz i dopłynięcie godz), 20 min snorkowania, średni obiad i kiepskie ceny to stanowczo za dużo. Dla mnie stracony dzień. Czas między 8-17 bez wielu pozytywow, można lepiej wykorzystać ten czas zostając na plaży, snoorkujac na podobnej rafie w każdym innym miejscu na wyspie, jedząc za połowę $ smaczniejsze rzeczy i mając lepsze widoki na zanzi plażach.
                            
                            Podróżowanie autem/skuterem - warto i nie ma z tym większych problemów. Za samochód płaciliśmy 30$ /dzień + permit 25$(przepłacone sporo ponoć można kupić perma za 10$). Spotkaliśmy się z sytuacją gdzie samochód nam się popsuł to po 1,5 h mieliśmy podstawiony nowy. Przy oddaniu auta nawet nie sprawdzali czy wszystko z nim jest okej :D
                            
                            Spicy tour - 1,5 h probowania, wąchania, uczenia się o przyprawach rosnących na wyspie. Było bardzo ciekawie i wesoło. Jak najbardziej polecam. 5-10$
                            
                            The rock - w sam raz na raz i chyba nie ma co więcej pisać. :) Nie żałujemy ale kopara nie opada :)
                            
                            Nam najbardziej się podobał rejsik ichniejsza żaglówka - poszliśmy na spacer wgłąb oceanu podczas odpływu, zapytaliśmy lokalsa czy nas zabierze ze sobą. Kosztowało nas to ok 10$. Pozwolił nam posterowac, pokazał piękne i wielkie starfishe a widoki i frajda zostaną w pamięci na zawsze. Najlepiej wydane pieniądze na zanzi.
                            Jedzenie na wyspie to sama przyjemność. Smakowalo nam praktycznie wszystko. Nie jedliśmy w żadnej polecanej knajpie a i tak było jami. Oddzielna kwestią jest to ze standardem jest czekanie godziny na zamówienie :)
                            Alkohol poza knajpami można kupić ponoć w dwóch miejscach na wyspie. My trafiliśmy do sklepu paje gdzie są alkohole mocne, piwo i papierosy w polskich cenach.
                            Trzeba się targować wszędzie. Zazwyczaj jest tak że wartosc produktu to cena wyjściowa podzielona na dwa.
                            Kupiliśmy dużo pamiątek w tym kilka obrazów przy czym za największy 1,5 m x 1,2m zapłaciliśmy ok 25-30$
                            Komarów trochę było ale nie będą uciążliwe jeżeli będziecie mieć na noc moskitierę nad lozkiem.
                            Ziółko łatwo dostępne na całej wyspie w jednej knajpie kupowaliśmy gotowego skręta :D
                            Nie polecam też robienia ogniska na plazy. Po zaledwie kilkunastu minutach zeszli się miejscowi i zamiast romantycznej kolacji po zmroku przy ognisku przenieśliśmy się do sąsiedniej knajpki :)
                            
                            Zanzibar to cudowne miejsce i cudowni ludzie. Pamiętajcie że życie na wyspie toczy się w rytmie hakuna matata i nikomu tam się nigdzie nie spieszy. Lokalsi często są zapominalscy (np nasz taksiarz przed samym wylotem spóźnił się godzinę i ledwo na samolot powrotny zdążyliśmy) i niczym się tam nie przejmują. W wielu miejscach traktują nas jak chodzące portfele ale mimo to są przyjaźni, uśmiechnięci i myślę że również szczęśliwi. Dzieci są na każdym kroku, są urocze i... i będziecie żałować że nic dla nich nie zabraliscie mimo powszechnych opinii żeby nic im nie dawać.
                            
                            Byliśmy już na wielu krańcach świata ale to póki co Zanzibar nas uwiódł, rozkochał i sprawił że wsiadając na samolot powrotny już za nim tęsknimy. Lecąc tam obawiałem się że to kolejne, podobne do innych miejsce typu rajska plaża i ocean, gdzie może być nudno. Pomyliłem się bardzo.
                            Zanzibar to unikat jakich coraz mniej na świecie.
                            Napewno tam wrócimy.</p>

                            Middle Eastern seafarers had just begun to take over the Indian Ocean trade routes in the 10th century and found Maldives to be an important link in those routes as the first landfall for traders from Basra sailing to Southeast Asia. Trade involved mainly cowrie shells—widely used as a form of currency throughout Asia and parts of the East African coast—and coir fiber. The Bengal Sultanate, where cowrie shells were used as legal tender, was one of the principal trading partners of the Maldives. The Bengal–Maldives cowry shell trade was the largest shell currency trade network in history.[45] The other essential product of the Maldives was coir, the fibre of the dried coconut husk, resistant to saltwater. It stitched together and rigged the dhows that plied the Indian Ocean. Maldivian coir was exported to Sindh, China, Yemen, and the Persian Gulf.</p>

                            <p>The importance of the Arabs as traders in the Indian Ocean by the 12th century may partly explain why the last Buddhist king of Maldives, Dhovemi, converted to Islam in the year 1153 (or 1193). Adopting the Muslim title of Sultan Muhammad al Adil, he initiated a series of six Islamic dynasties that lasted until 1932 when the sultanate became elective. The formal title of the sultan up to 1965 was, Sultan of Land and Sea, Lord of the twelve-thousand islands and Sultan of the Maldives which came with the style Highness.

                                    Somali Muslim Abu'l Barakat al-Barbari, also known as Aw Barkhadle, is traditionally credited for this conversion. According to the story told to Ibn Battutah, a mosque was built with the inscription: 'The Sultan Ahmad Shanurazah accepted Islam at the hand of Abu'l Barakat al-Barbari.'[30][31] Some scholars have suggested the possibility of Ibn Battuta misreading Maldive texts, and having a bias towards the North African, Maghrebi narrative of this Shaykh, instead of the East African origins account that was known as well at the time.[32] Even when Ibn Battuta visited the islands, the governor of the island at that time was Abd Aziz Al Mogadishawi, a Somali[33]
                                    
                                    Scholars have posited another scenario where this Abu Barakat might have been a native of Barbera, a significant trading port on the northwestern coast of Somalia.[34] Barbara or Barbaroi (Berbers), as the ancestors of the Somalis were referred to by medieval Arab and ancient Greek geographers, respectively.[35][36][37] This is also seen when Ibn Batuta visited Mogadishu, he mentions that the Sultan at that time, "Abu Bakr ibn Shaikh Omar", was a Berber (Somali). According to scholars, Abu Barakat Al Barbari was Yusuf bin Ahmad al-Kawneyn, a famous native Somali scholar [38] known for establishing the Walashma dynasty of the Horn of Africa.[39] After his conversion of the population of Dogor (now known as Aw Barkhadle), a town in Somalia, he is also credited to have been responsible for spreading Islam in the Maldivian islands, establishing the Hukuru Miskiiy Mosque, and converting the Maldivian population to Islam.[40][41] Ibn Batuta states the Maldivian king was converted by Abu Al Barakat Al Berber (Blessed Father of Somalia).[42]
                                    
                                    Others have it he may have been from the Persian town of Tabriz.[43] The first reference to an Iranian origin dates to an 18th-century Persian text.[44]
                                    
                                    His venerated tomb now stands on the grounds of Hukuru Mosque, or miski, in the capital of Malé. Built in 1656, this is the oldest mosque in Maldives. Following the Islamic concept that before Islam there was the time of Jahiliya (ignorance), in the history books used by Maldivians the introduction of Islam at the end of the 12th century is considered the cornerstone of the country's history.
                                    
                                    Compared to the other areas of South Asia, the conversion of the Maldives to Islam happened relatively late. Arab traders had converted populations in the Malabar Coast since the 7th century, and Muhammad Bin Qāsim had converted large swathes of Sindh to Islam at about the same time. The Maldives remained a Buddhist kingdom for another 500 years after the conversion of Malabar Coast and Sindh—perhaps as the southwesternmost Buddhist country. Arabic became the prime language of administration (instead of Persian and Urdu), and the Maliki school of jurisprudence was introduced, both hinting at direct contacts with the core of the Arab world.
